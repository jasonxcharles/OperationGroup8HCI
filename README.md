An internship guide/search engine. 
The premise is simple, it helps students find internships. Usually when we’re looking for new opportunties we go to LinkedIn or some students' use readMe’s/excel sheets, but that can get boring/difficult to navigate fast. It’s basic front-end we can put hyperlinks, and we can match them with expected comp sci major year/skill set.
